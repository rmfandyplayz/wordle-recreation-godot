or jus head to the "release" page and find what u need
(or just download source code 'n load it into godot so u can check for viruses)

this is literally just a recreation of wordle as my first project for game development class at my school. it's also my first ever project done in godot instead of unity.\
i don't really give a crap what you do with it, although credits would be nice???????

the game is finished now, but i probably will be making smaller quality-of-life updates if I want to

üéµ if you want to find the music I used, go [here](https://github.com/rmfandyplayz/wordle-recreation-godot/tree/main/Media/Audio/Music) and browse the files. they all have their titles and artists listed.
if i am to make an update in the near future, one of the first ones is to have an in-game feature to properly credit everything i've used
